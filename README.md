# Iron Man Suit
- Life-scale model of Tony Stark's suit
- Inspired by the Iron Man series and wanted to replicate the technology
- Future plans: integrate motors to the helmet and LED wiring to make it a little more realistic (planning to do this after aquiring the right skills)<br><br>

- Replicated the Iron Man suit using card-stock paper as the frame and cardboard overlay
- Solidified the helmet, chest, and arm pieces using fibreglass cloth with polyester resin coatings
- Coated the helmet with primer to achieve a glossy finish with metallic spray paint; mimicked metal
